Odd run. I think the new GAEN turned itself off a few
mins after the device booted. Had to go do the "turn
on debug mode with no sig checking and re-enable the
app.

The putlong script also hung in that state, not sure
if that's an issue really.

Doing it over after re-enabling app.

Turns out there were two config/google/COVID settings
apps running in background while GPS was updated so
I guess the old one didn't work and was holding the
socket open or something. Had to kill both those. A
reboot didn't do it.
